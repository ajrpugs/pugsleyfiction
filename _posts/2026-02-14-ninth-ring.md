title: The Ninth Ring

It was a brisk evening in late October, and the autumn leaves fluttered gently through the air onto Wesley and Lauren’s front yard. Their red-bricked Victorian home stood handsomely on its quiet piece of countryside, one tile in the crimson mosaic of foliage that enveloped the property.

Lauren took in the season’s colours from the living room window and felt a subtle sense of melancholy, the kind that the fall often nurtures as the trees prepare for their deep, cold slumber. She didn’t spend long in this feeling, however, for her anticipation of the night’s events led her back from her somber reflections.

Wesley vacuumed the carpet, and Lauren returned to the kitchen to tidy. Before long they heard the crunching of gravel as the first of their guests pulled into the driveway. At the front door the homeowners greeted the new arrivals. Pleasantries, a gift of wine, coats draped over the arm of a loveseat in a shaded corner, and a barking little dog, scooped up into Wesley’s arms and hushed.

Soon others arrived, and the group of friends chattered over drinks and finger food. Some stood in the kitchen, and others sat in the stylishly furnished living room that softly glowed with ambient lighting. A downtempo rhythm floated through the happy crowd. Outside, the sun had set, and the moon cast it's pale silver haze over the countryside.

After an hour of catching up with their guests, Wesley pulled Lauren to the side for a word.

"Well, what do you say?" he asked with a sly smile. "Think it's time?"

Lauren smiled.

"Yes, yes, l do. Why don't you bring it out to the living room and let's get started." she replied. "We've made them wait long enough."

Wesley went upstairs and returned carrying a large black carrying case. He held it by the handle and walked it over to the center of the room. He placed it on the living room floor and the small crowd of friends gathered around, smiling at one another with anticipation. 

"So you weren't pulling our leg after all, eh Wesley?" said John. "You really got your hands on one. I guess we'll be staying!" 

He and the others laughed playfully as they watched Wesley undo the clasps along the lid of the black case with a series of snaps. 

"Yes, I really did." Wesley said with a chuckle. "I promise we wouldn't make you all drive out here for nothing. One of the perks of working for Neuravana I suppose." 

Lauren leaned on the inside of the door frame behind him and smiled with pride.

He undid the last clasp, removed the lid from the body of the case, and placed it off to the side. With both hands he lifted a large white sphere from the case and placed it on the table for all to see. It was roughly half a meter in diameter with a smooth glass surface. When Wesley plugged it into the wall, a white light began pulsing somewhere deep in its core. 

"It's beautiful!" Aurora said. "Just simply elegant."

"This model is called the Neuropool." said Wesley. "In my opinion, it's one of the best local memory pools available to the public right now. Supports up to eight connections, twice as many as the old model. It blows it out of the water on realism too."

He pressed the top of the sphere and eight white data cards slid smoothly out of hidden slots around the base of the device. One for each of the attendees.

"Well, what are we waiting for?" he asked. He removed one of cards from it's slot and held it up for the room to see. "Let's start the fun. Make yourselves comfortable." He slid the card into the port behind his left ear with a satisfying click and sunk into the nearby couch.

One by one they pulled a card from a slot and found themselves a seat. Ben was the last to pull a card. He took the last one from the device, but instead of slotting it behind his ear, he paused for a moment, holding it up to his eye with his thumb and index finger. 

"I'm not so sure about this" he said after a moment's reflection.

Aurora reached for his hand to reassure him. "Don't worry, love. It's completely safe. Right, Wes? I've used a similar model before and it was wonderful."

Wes nodded his head in agreement. "Completely safe, man." he said. "It's an air-gapped and encrypted local network. No data leaves this room and nothing stays on the pool once you eject the data card. You have my word."

Ben glanced nervously around the living room. The seven others were spread throughout and watched him with concern. 

Aurora squeezed his hand and met his gaze. "Just sit here with me and see if you like it." she said. He looked at the white data card, the network of intricate connections barely visible on the surface. He sighed and sat down beside Aurora. "Well, alright. Let's do it."

Wes got up, tapped the device once on it's side, and sat back down with a relaxed sigh. For a brief moment he felt dizzy, slightly disoriented, as the data chip came online and began to work it's way into his neural networks. The Pool sang a gentle tune, and above the device, a large floating lotus flower faded into view, blooming and rotating to the amazement of the group. After it's opening dance, a circle of white rings appeared and rotated the Pool in a slow orbit. Each of the guests names appeared above a ring.

Ben laughed nervously and was unable to contain his smile. "Holy shit."

"Who should we start with?" asked Wes. 

Aurora smiled and raised her hand. "I want to try!"

The group nodded and agreed. "Alright" said Wes. "Think of a memory that you want to share with us. Focus your attention on the ring in front of you. Everyone else do the same, and hold it for five seconds."

Aurora recalled a memory and focused on her ring. 

As Wes focused on the ring, he watched as the room around him began to fall away, dissolving into digital pieces that floated off into nothingness. Although he was sitting upright, his sense of direction faltered, and he felt his body change positions. A new scene opened up before him. He was laying on his back, looking up at a cerulean sky. A warm breeze blew over him, and he could hear music from somewhere in the distance, a woman's voice ringing out over reverbed guitars and soft synthesizers. Balloons and kites danced in the air high above. He felt a hand in his, gentle, loving, and he felt euphoric in that moment, letting the sun and the wind and the music wash over him and take him away. 

The sun began to dim, the blue sky faded away, and he was back on the couch, sitting upright on the couch. They all looked at each other in wonder with grins on their faces. Words were like shadows, empty and dark compared to what they had all just experienced. To hear the memories of others put into language and told to you suddenly felt like a cruel lie. To feel what they felt, to see what they saw, to hear what they heard, this was connection. Wes looked around the room and saw the same revelation dawning on his friends as they came back down to reality.

"I can't believe how real it felt" Lauren said, beaming with joy. "I was really there, at the festival, I was really Aurora."

"It's unbelievable" said Ben.

The white rings spun gently around the Pool, but this time something seemed different. He counted the hovering circles. 

"That's strange" said Wes, puzzled. "There's another ring." He leaned closer in and furrowed his brow. Where there had been eight, there were now nine, still circling the Pool as though nothing had changed.

Lauren laughed nervously. "Maybe it's a bug."

"I guess it is, but that shouldn't be possible" said Wes. "There's only eight data chips, and there's eight of us. I don't know why it would be rendering another ring."

"Why don't we see what it is?" said Ben, feeling braver now after Aurora's memory. Nobody objected, and he began to focus on the ninth ring. 

The walls of the room faded away and were replaced by rows of passing trees, and Wes was driving down road under the moonlight. The trees on the side of the road were illuminated by the headlights, and his hands turned the steering wheel around the gentle bends in the road that cut through the forest. It was quiet but for the drone of the engine. The interior of the car was illuminated with a pale blue from glowing blue monitors in the back.

Wes felt his hands turn the steering wheel around a right hand turn, onto a road leading deeper into the forest. The tires crunched over the gravel as the car continued, and the memory began to fade into black.

Wes looked at Lauren with confusion as he and the others came back to themselves. "That was our driveway" Lauren said with unease. "See, it must be a bug. It was one of us arriving tonight. Whose car was that?"

The eight of them looked around the room at one another for an answer. It was clear that nobody recognized the vehicle. 

On the table, the slowly pulsing white light in the Neuropool began to pulse faster in an irregular rhythm. Wes hadn't seen it do that before.

"Okay, I don't like this" said Ben. 

"Me neither" said Wes. "I've never seen a bug like this before. Okay everyone, I'm sorry, but let's pull out our data cards and I'll run a quick check. I don't fully understand what's happening here."

Wes touched the data card behind his ear with a click, but the card didn't eject. Eyes widening, he pressed it again, and again, but the card remained firmly in the socket. His heart sank as he watched the others pressing their cards with the same result. 

His confusion began to take on a tone of paranoia. He walked past the flickering Neuropool over to the wall outlet and unplugged the device. Instead of turning off, the device continued to pulse, changing colours to a pale blue. His vision flickered for an instant, and he was back in the car, pulling into his own driveway, the red-bricked home in the headlights, before he was wrenched back to the living room and the panicked faces of his friends. 

The group began to murmur to each other and the atmosphere grew fearful. 

"Everyone just stay here" Wes said. "Let me try something." He left the living room and walked unsteadily towards the front door. In truth he was out of ideas, and in his paranoid state he thought of the car pulling in to the driveway, the look on Lauren's face.

He opened the door and stepped out into the cold autumn air. He rubbed his eyes in disbelief. Behind his friend's cards, a boxy black van was parked. He walked down the front steps and onto the driveway, approaching the van. As he drew closer, he noticed that the windows of the van were frosted over, and Wes couldn't see inside. A faint sound of music grew louder as he approached. It was coming from the van. Wes recognized the song. Soft synthesizers, reverb drenched guitars, and the gentle voice crooning over the instrumentation. 

He reached for the handle and pulled open the door. Instead of the interior of the van that he saw in the ninth ring, it was a floating cloud of symbols, buzzing and hissing and flickering and seeping out of the van like dry ice.

Wes opened his eyes, and he was back in the living room, no longer on the couch that he previously sat on, no longer seeing through his own eyes. He tried to sit up and couldn't move his body. This body. 

The warm ambient lighting of the living room was drowned out from above. He looked at the ceiling, and instead of white plaster, the open blue sky yawned above. He felt like he was looking down into it, stuck to the roof of the world, like he could fall into space and continue in that direction for eternity. Kites and balloons below him, dancing among the white tufts of clouds. 

Looking down, across the living room, he saw himself on the couch, from this other's perspective, his eyes rolled back in his head, his leg twitching ever so slightly. He felt sick. The others were doing the same. Beside him, in his peripheral vision, was Aurora, eyes also rolled back, lost in herself, her hand twitching softly in his, holding tighter, looser, tighter, looser. Above the Pool the rings spun around and around, and a lotus flower opened and closed, opened and closed. 

In the pink glow of the lotus ever-blooming lotus, a figure knelt before the Pool, one palm placed on the glass surface, face obscured by a nebulous cloud, and for a moment Wes thought he saw his own face in the vapor, for another moment Lauren's. The Neuropool sang it's tune once more.

Outside, the leaves descended through the cold autumn air like pixels bleeding into nothing.
